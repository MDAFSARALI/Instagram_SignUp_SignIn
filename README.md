## Instagram-Like User Page with Conditional Rendering
# Project Overview
This project is a React application that simulates a user page similar to Instagram. The primary focus of this assignment is to implement conditional rendering, allowing users to either sign up or log in based on their selection. The user interface dynamically displays different input fields depending on the user's choice, making the interaction intuitive and user-friendly.

# Features: 
Conditional Rendering: The application conditionally renders different views for signing up and logging in.
Responsive User Interface: A clean and intuitive design inspired by Instagram.
User Inputs:
# Login: Basic input fields for username and password.
# Sign Up: Additional fields for name, email, and other registration details when the user opts to sign up.
# Toggle Functionality: A button allows users to switch between the sign-up and login views seamlessly.
Technologies Used
React: Functional components and React Hooks are used to manage state and component lifecycles.
CSS: Custom CSS is used for styling the components to mimic Instagram’s clean layout.

Setup: The project starts by setting up a React application with functional components.
Conditional Rendering: The state of the application determines whether to display the sign-up or login view. This is handled using React’s conditional rendering feature.
Component Structure: The app is structured into separate components such as Header, Login, Signup, and App. The main logic to toggle between views is placed in the App component.
Styling: The application is styled using CSS to replicate Instagram’s look and feel.
Code Documentation
App Component: Contains the main logic for toggling between the sign-up and login views.
Header Component: Displays the Instagram logo and the toggle button.
Login Component: Renders input fields for username and password.
Signup Component: Renders additional input fields for registration.
Each component is well-documented within the code to explain the logic behind the implementation.

Testing
Thorough testing has been conducted to ensure all functionalities work as expected. This includes:

Verifying that the correct inputs appear when toggling between sign-up and login.
Ensuring that the layout remains consistent across different screen sizes.
Future Improvements
Validation: Implement form validation to ensure users enter valid data.
Backend Integration: Connect the form inputs to a backend API for user authentication and registration.
